In recent years nearly all my work has been on Node.js based projects using JavaScript.

But previously I built Ruby on Rails based services that often had 'something' (don't ask!) built in Java.

It has been more than a year since I have needed to dive into those projects. So, with this new build I've decided not to add the tools I need for them. But just in case, I've moved them here.
