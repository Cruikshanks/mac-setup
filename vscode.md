# VS Code

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my main editor for all work.

## Install

```bash
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

## Configure

### Add VSCode to PATH

First thing is to add **VSCode** to the path so we can open it from the command line. Enter SHIFT+COMMAND+P and search for "Install 'code' command in PATH" and select it.

## Settings sync

In the bottom right is the **Accounts** button. Sign in using GitHub and then enable settings sync. Leave everthing ticked.

All my VSCode settings, extensions, and their settings should then download and sync up VSCode with how I like to use it.
