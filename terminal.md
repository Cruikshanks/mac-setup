# Terminal

Because I use [iTerm2](iterm2.md), and with OSX Catalina switching to zsh as the default shell, I don't really bother to configure Terminal anymore.

## Settings

Open the **Terminal** preferences then select `Shell` for the profile being used (I stick with 'Basic'). Then set

- When the shell exits: `Close if the shell exited cleanly`
