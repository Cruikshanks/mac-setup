# Mac setup

This repo simply serves as respository for how I setup various things on a Mac, in case of the time when I either change or it blows up!

General and base stuff will go here. App or tool specific stuff will have their own files.

- [Git](git.md)
- [Vim](vim.md)
- [Terminal](terminal.md)

## General

Changes I make to the Mac in settings to get it how I like it.

### System Preferences > Mission Control

- Untick `Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use`. This will stop my full screen apps from moving position.
- Untick `Group windows by application`. Should be able to more easily move between the windows of an app.
- Set Dashboard as `As space`. This is what enables the sticky notes in the far left Space on a Mac.

### System Preferences > Trackpad

- In options for secondary click choose `Click in bottom right corner`

### System Preferences > Dock

- Tick `Automatically hide and show the Dock`

### System Preferences > Energy Saver

- Power adapter > Untick `Put hard disks to sleep when possible` and `Wake up for Wi-Fi network access`

### System Preferences > General

- Tick `Use dark menu bar and Dock`
- Click in the scroll bar to `Jump to the spot that's clicked`

## Base installations

Core stuff I install to then get over things loaded and/or setup.

- Homebrew `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
- Homebrew cask `brew tap caskroom/cask`
